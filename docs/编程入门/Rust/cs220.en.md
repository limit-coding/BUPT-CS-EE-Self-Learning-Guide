# CS220: Programming Principles

## Descriptions

- Offered by: KAIST
- Prerequisites: Any programming language
- Programming Languages: Rust
- Difficulty: 🌟🌟🌟
- Class Hour: 40 hours

[Jeehoon Kang](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang) from KAIST and his [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/) appear to be strong advocates of the Rust programming language. Their contributions include [CS431](./cs431.md) and [CS420](../../编译原理/CS420.md) in the csdiy curriculum. Naturally, they have developed an introductory course for Rust, which is this course. It covers most of the essential topics needed to get started with Rust.

This course does not have an official textbook. The course homepage recommends using the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for learning and provides a structured learning path in the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17G3SwkE_tq0H3lTt9N0ysIbHhqDZBfHkoWD5LwwAKSo/edit#slide=id.p). Although there are no publicly available lecture videos, the comprehensive testing system makes this course an excellent resource for practicing Rust. Some exercises can serve as a great supplement to [CS110L](./CS110L.md). If you still feel the need for more practice after completing CS110L, this course is a good choice. Some exercises are quite challenging, and Jeehoon Kang encourages the use of AI-assisted programming. However, AI is not perfect, and the core work must still be done by yourself.

## Personal Resources

There are no publicly available answer keys, and it is unclear whether the course instructor supports the idea of sharing solutions. If you encounter difficulties, you can find discussions about the assignments in the [ISSUE](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs220/issues) section of the repository.
