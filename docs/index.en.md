# Foreword

This guide is based on [CS Self-Learning Guide](https://csdiy.wiki) and curated for BUPT students as a Communication/Computer Science self-learning resource.

The book currently includes:

- **User guide**: Usage suggestions for different audiences and learning goals.
- **CS learning plan**: A reference, systematic self-learning plan.
- **Productivity toolkit**: IDE, VPN, Git, Vim, LaTeX, Docker, workflow, etc.
- **Book recommendations**: Classic books and resources by topic.
- **High-quality CS/EE courses**: Course summaries and self-learning tips; many have separate repos for materials and assignments.

## Where to start —— CS61A

If you are new to programming, [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/) is a solid first step: clear site, open textbook, and well-designed labs and projects.

## Why use this guide

Good courses explain concepts clearly and reinforce them with assignments. This guide organizes courses and resources into a reference path so you can pick what fits your goals.

## Pros and cons of self-learning

**Pros**: Pace your learning, rewatch hard parts and skip easy ones; learn from multiple schools; more flexible schedule.

**Cons**: Less direct interaction—rely on search and community; most resources are in English; self-discipline matters when there is no DDL.

## Who is this for

Anyone who wants to self-learn CS/EE can use it. With prior background, pick only the sections you need; if you are just starting, treat it as one possible route and adapt as you go.

## Thanks
